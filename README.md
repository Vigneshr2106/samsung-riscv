This image showcases a terminal session in Ubuntu where the user compiles and executes a C program named sum1ton.c.

Compilation: The gcc compiler is used to compile the sum1ton.c file, resulting in the executable a.out.

First Execution: The executable is run, calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 10, which is displayed as 55.

Recompilation and Second Execution: The program is recompiled, and the executable is run again, this time calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 9535, which is displayed as 45462880.

This demonstrates the process of compiling and running a program as well as how program input/output changes based on different parameters.
